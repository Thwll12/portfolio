## AI-Enhanced Audio Projects

These projects demonstrate my use of **ElevenLabs AI voiceover** for instructional design and video simulations. Each project showcases AI-generated audio integrated into eLearning or training materials.

💡 **Tip:** You can place this section near the top of your README.md under a “Projects” or “Portfolio” heading so employers see your AI experience immediately.

If you want, I can also **draft a short introduction paragraph** to go above this table that frames your AI audio work as a **key modern instructional design skill** — it makes your portfolio read more professionally. Do you want me to do that?
